# Neo4J Airport Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Neo4J Airport Data Analysis Project! This repository contains the work of our team dedicated to exploring and analyzing airport data using the Neo4J database. Our aim is to uncover hidden patterns and insights from the dataset through complex queries and visualizations.

## Project Description
This project involves the use of Neo4J, a graph database, to analyze and visualize data related to airports and their routes. By querying the database, we aim to uncover interesting patterns and relationships within the data. The project includes a comprehensive report detailing our methods, queries, and findings, as well as the datasets and query files used for this analysis.
